# Park Trainer

This is a simple radio controlled trainer that is intended to instruct the user in how to scratch build an RC aircraft as well as how to fly one. 

It's made from paper backed "ready-board" that can be bought at DollarTree stores. An entire airframe, including glue, can be built for around $5 US. A link to detailed build instructions can be found on https://mellowthings.com.

To create a set of paper templates, simply print out the PDF files. Transfer the template to the ready-board by poking holes at the corners and drawing it out with a straight edge.
